# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

This is what the homepage of the app looks like. It gives access to all the shorted links created by the user.

This is the id page which allows users to navigate to the shortened link they created or edit and update the URL provided.

Users can easily register for a free account to start shortening links.
